			<h2>1. Stephen Hawking’s PhD thesis almost broke the internet</h2><br/><br/>
<p>Professor Stephen Hawking made his PhD thesis,  Properties of expanding universes, freely available to anyone, anywhere in the world. It proved so popular - over 750,000 downloads - that it broke our Open Access repository, Apollo.</p><br/><br/>

<p>Of course, we all understood its contents. Ahem.</p>

			<h2>2. Sheep can recognise Barack Obaa-ma</h2><br/><br/>
<p>Sheep can be trained to recognise human faces from photographic portraits.</p>

<p>Our researchers showed sheep pictures of four celebrities - former US President Barack Obama, movie stars Emma Watson and Jake Gyllenhall, and BBC presenter Fiona Bruce. The sheep were able to identify pictures of them in a task, as well as recognising photos of their handlers.</p>

<p>Cue a barrage of terrible sheep-related puns. The BBC went as far as to credit Cambridge Ewe-niversity.</p>

			<h2>3. We found out who gave us herpes</h2><br/><br/>
<p>Herpes, it seems, has been around for a very long time. In modern humans the virus manifests as cold sores (HSV1) and genital herpes (HSV2). While chimpanzee precursors carried both strains, when our ancient lineage split from them around 7 million years ago, we took only HSV1. Humanity had dodged the genital herpes bullet.</p>

<p>Almost.</p>
<p>It isn't every day that a press release from our University includes the line "While discussing genital herpes over dinner at King's College, Cambridge..."</p>

			<h2>4. Celebrities behave like bots on Twitter</h2><br/><br/>
<p>‘Celebrity’ Twitter accounts – those with more than 10 million followers – display more bot-like behaviour than users with fewer followers.</p>

<p>Zafar Gilani, a PhD student at our Computer Laboratory, was quoted at the time as saying: “Many people tend to think that bots are nefarious or evil, but that’s not true.”</p>

<p>@realdonaldtrump, it should be noted, has over 43 million followers. Could he really be a bot?</p>
